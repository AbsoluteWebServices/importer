## üîß Usage

Run the tool using the following syntax:

```
./importer [media|sql|both] [server IP address] [SSH port (optional, default: 22)]
```
### Arguments
`media` ‚Äì Copies media files (in an archive format) from the remote server to the local machine.

`sql` ‚Äì Creates a SQL dump on the remote server and downloads it to the local machine.

`both` ‚Äì Downloads both media files and a SQL dump.

### Example
```
./importer both 192.168.1.100
```
This will use SSH to connect to 192.168.1.100 (on port 22) and download both media and SQL files.

## üîê SSH Authentication
You can authenticate using:

`Password` ‚Äì You'll be prompted to enter the password when connecting.

`SSH key` ‚Äì If no password is provided, the app will try to use your default key at `~/.ssh/id_rsa`.
